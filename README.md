# Historic Academic Timeline of NLP
You can find most popular and game-changer literature with their respective article links in [article_list](https://github.com/ozcangundes/NLP_Articles/blob/master/article_list.md). Also, you can download .xlsx file from [NLP Timeline](https://github.com/ozcangundes/NLP_Articles/blob/master/NLP%20Timeline.xlsx).

I covered most of them, but the field is quickly evolving. Therefore, if you know newer articles or approaches, please feel free to contact me to add them to this list.

I hope it will be beneficial for your journey :)
