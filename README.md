# Academic Timeline of NLP
You can find most popular and game-changer literatures with their respective names, years and citations in [article_list](https://github.com/ozcangundes/NLP_Articles/blob/master/article_list.md). Also, you can download .xlsx file from [NLP Timeline](https://github.com/ozcangundes/NLP_Articles/blob/master/NLP%20Timeline.xlsx).

I covered most of them, but the field is quickly evolving. Therefore, if you know newer articles or approaches, please feel free to [contact](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%B6zcan-g%C3%BCnde%C5%9F-7693055b/) me to add them to this list.

I hope it will be beneficial for your journey :)
